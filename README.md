# GSG-Docker-Assignment

Everything works perfectcio except for the docker push thingy.
It will work in the future inshaa'allah but for now I just need to verify my email but it's a bit buggy. Fixing it will cause me some headache so I will leave it for now.

to be exact I can't push on a repo that does not exist, and to make a repo I need a verified account which I don't have ATM

Update: Everything works as intended.

Shoutout to: Team without m Team.
